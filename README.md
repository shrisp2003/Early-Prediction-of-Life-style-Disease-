# Early-Prediction-of-Life-style-Disease-
Webpage Project
Developed a web-based application to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Liver Disease, and Cardiovascular Disease using machine learning algorithms.

Achieved a model accuracy of up to 99% with Random Forest Classifier, outperforming other models like Decision Tree, SVM, and Naive Bayes.

Implemented Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature selection to improve prediction efficiency.

Applied multiple machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, ANN) to compare and select the best-performing model.

Integrated a user-friendly web interface with modules for sign-up, login, and disease prediction dashboards.

Designed a recommendation system to provide actionable suggestions based on predicted disease outcomes.

Focused on full feature utilization for higher accuracy and reliable disease prediction.

Utilized datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Projected future scope for time-based predictions and risk stratification to enable early interventions and personalized healthcare recommendations.
